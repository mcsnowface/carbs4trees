## The English Channel

I'm preparing for a big challenge: crossing the English Channel in June 2025. With just a speedo, goggles, and a swim cap, I'll be taking on the cold water. Currently, fewer than 2000 people have managed to cross the English Channel. However, this endeavor isn't just about personal achievement; it also reflects my commitment to environmental protection. As part of my goal to plant trees, I've created a [GoFundMe](https://gofund.me/fdba468f) page for this event. Take a look and let's work together to reforest the planet, one tree at a time!

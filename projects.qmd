## The English Channel

I'm preparing for a big challenge: crossing the English Channel in June 2025. With just a speedo, goggles, and a swim cap, I'll be taking on the cold water. This endeavor isn't just about personal achievement; it also reflects my commitment to environmental protection. Currently, fewer than 2000 people have managed to cross the English Channel. As part of my goal to plant 1 million trees, I've created a GoFundMe page for this event. Take a look and let's work together to reforest the planet, one tree at a time.

## Hello, I'm Stefan â€“ Nice to meet you!

I'm a husband, father of 3, biologist, and endurance athlete from Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. In 2024 at the age of 44 years old, I established **my ultimate life goal of raising funds to plant trees for the next 44 years**. My mission is to achieve this goal through challenging ultra-endurance events.

I've completed numerous Ironman Triathlons (9:23:51), including the Ironman World Championships in Kona, Hawaii (10:06:53), ultramarathons of up to 100 miles (19:56:50), and also hold the course record in the 100 km Lost Soul Ultra Marathon in Lethbridge, Alberta, Canada (10:07:00).

Eager to know more about my journey? [Don't hesitate to reach out](mailto:carbs4trees@gmail.com)!

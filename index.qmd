## Hello, I'm Stefan â€“ Nice to meet you!

I'm a husband, father of 3, biologist, and endurance athlete from Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. In 2024 at the age of 44 years old, I established my ultimate life goal: **to plant as many trees as I possibly can**. My mission is to accomplish this through challenging ultra-endurance events paired with fundraising campaigns. 

I've completed numerous Ironman Triathlons (9:23:51), including the Ironman World Championships in Kona, Hawaii (10:06:53), ultramarathons of up to 100 miles (19:56:50), and also hold the course record in the 100 km Lost Soul Ultra Marathon in Lethbridge, Alberta, Canada (10:07:00).

For my upcoming adventure, I'm getting ready to [swim across the English Channel from England to France](https://www.carbs4trees.com/projects#the-english-channel). However, it's not just about the challenge; it's also about spreading awareness of the vital role trees play in our lives. Trees quietly contribute to clean air, biodiversity, and serve as sources of food, shelter, and tranquility. Through this swim, I hope to raise awareness on the importance of preserving and planting trees for a healthier planet and a brighter future for generations to come. Please consider visiting my [GoFundMe Page](https://gofund.me/fdba468f) and contributing to my mission of planting trees. Your support will make a significant impact on creating a greener, more sustainable future one tree at a time!

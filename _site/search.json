In 2024 at the age of 44 years old, I established my ultimate life goal: to plant as many trees as I possibly can. My mission is to accomplish this through challenging ultra-endurance events paired with fundraising campaigns.\nI’ve completed numerous Ironman Triathlons (9:23:51), including the Ironman World Championships in Kona, Hawaii (10:06:53), ultramarathons of up to 100 miles (19:56:50), and also hold the course record in the 100 km Lost Soul Ultra Marathon in Lethbridge, Alberta, Canada (10:07:00).\nFor my upcoming adventure, I’m getting ready to swim across the English Channel from England to France. However, it’s not just about the challenge; it’s also about spreading awareness of the vital role trees play in our lives. Trees quietly contribute to clean air, biodiversity, and serve as sources of food, shelter, and tranquility. Through this swim, I hope to raise awareness on the importance of preserving and planting trees for a healthier planet and a brighter future for generations to come.

Mastering life, especially during the years when it matters most, is probably the most difficult.\nWhy am I telling you all this? Isn’t this website about crazy endurance events? Yes, it is. Life is by far the craziest endurance event of all and I want to remind you to prioritize your mental well-being. It’s okay to ask for help, to rest, or to take things one day at a time. Just like with swimming, every small effort adds up!\nWhen I look back at June 2024, it feels like a whirlwind of cold water, determination, and heartwarming support. My journey toward swimming the English Channel took me to Dover, a place that’s become a hub for open-water swimmers dreaming of crossing that legendary stretch of water."

    "text": "Training in Dover: Cold, Long, and (Mostly) Amazing\nDover was every bit as challenging as I’d imagined. I joined the Dover Channel Training Group, a fantastic community of swimmers who welcomed me with open arms. The water hovered around 15°C (59°F), and while that might sound unbearable to some, it became my new normal.\nOver the 2 weeks, I pushed my body to adapt. One-hour swims turned into two, then three, then four. The cold was a constant companion, but there’s something magical about getting lost in the rhythm of your stroke, with nothing but the sound of the water around you.\nDespite all the progress, I didn’t manage to complete my six-hour qualifying swim—an essential milestone for my English Channel attempt in June 2025. The rules require that this swim be done in water no warmer than 15.6°C (60°F), which adds an extra layer of challenge to an already grueling task. I won’t lie; it was frustrating to fall short. I’d come so far but still had this big box left to check."

In March, I’ll head to La Jolla, California, where the cold Pacific waters will give me the chance to complete this essential milestone.\nThe challenge won’t be easy. I’ll need to endure both the physical toll of long-distance swimming and the mental battle of pushing through hours of cold water. But I’m ready to face it head-on, with the lessons I’ve learned in Dover and the encouragement of everyone who’s supported me so far."

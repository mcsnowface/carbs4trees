    "text": "Starting something new is always difficult. Raising a family is very difficult. Staying mentally healthy is extremely difficult. Mastering life, especially during the years when it matters most, is probably the most difficult.\nWhy am I telling you all this? Isn’t this website about endurance events? Yes, it is. But life itself is the ultimate endurance event, and I want to take a moment to remind you to prioritize your mental well-being. It’s okay to ask for help, to rest, or to take things one day at a time. Just like with swimming, every small effort adds up\nWhen I look back at June 2024, it feels like a whirlwind of cold water, determination, and heartwarming support. My journey toward swimming the English Channel took me to Dover, a place that’s become a hub for open-water swimmers dreaming of crossing that legendary stretch of water."

    "text": "Training in Dover: Cold, Long, and (Mostly) Amazing\nDover was every bit as challenging as I’d imagined. I joined the Dover Channel Training Group, a fantastic community of swimmers who welcomed me with open arms. The water hovered around 15°C (59°F), and while that might sound unbearable to some, it became my new normal.\nOver the 2 weeks, I pushed my body to adapt. One-hour swims turned into two, then three, then four. The cold was a constant companion, but there’s something magical about getting lost in the rhythm of your stroke, with nothing but the sound of the water around you.\nDespite all the progress, I didn’t manage to complete my six-hour qualifying swim—an essential milestone for my English Channel attempt in June 2025. The rules require that this swim be done in water no warmer than 15.6°C (60°F), which adds an extra layer of challenge to an already grueling task. I won’t lie; it was frustrating to fall short. I’d come so far but still had this big box left to check."

I’ll need to endure both the physical toll of long-distance swimming and the mental battle of pushing through hours of cold water. But I’m ready to face it head-on, with the lessons I’ve learned in Dover and the encouragement of everyone who’s supported me so far."

    "text": "Last week, I had the incredible opportunity to participate in a cold water swimming training camp in La Jolla, California. This wasn’t just about checking off the required six hour qualifying swim for my upcoming English Channel attempt; it was an immersion into the world of marathon swimming alongside an inspiring community of like-minded athletes!\nThe marathon swimming community is truly something special, welcoming, encouraging, and filled with people who genuinely want to see each other succeed. Huge thanks to Dan Simonelli and Jeff Rake for organizing the camp and creating an environment where swimmers of all levels could push their limits and learn from one another.\nI arrived in La Jolla on Wednesday (March 26, 2025) and stayed until Sunday, with the six hour qualifying swim scheduled for Saturday morning. Jeff and Rachael picked me up from the airport in San Diego. Coming from Edmonton, I felt like I was entering a tropical paradise! Jeff handed me a bottle of water right away, along with one of his homemade Shark Repellänt cereal bars. DELICIOUS! The perfect size and extremely yummy! We then waited for another camp participant from Virginia, Derek, who turned out to be my roommate for the camp and my sunscreen-apply-on-the-back buddy :). If you’ve ever swum under the sun, you know how important that is! Throughout the camp, we swam twice a day in the open ocean, often sharing the water with curious sea lions and navigating through some rough conditions.\nWhile I enjoyed all the swimming and chatting leading up to the long Saturday swim, I have to admit that this six hour swim was weighing heavily on my mind. Last year, I went to Dover in June to test the waters, literally, to see if I could swim for six hours in the Dover Harbour. I trained with the Dover Channel Training Group, another wonderful and welcoming group of open water swimmers. However, it turned out I was only able to build up to a 4 hour swim because I was shivering and way too cold. At that point, I really felt deflated, wondering if I might not be cut out for this sport.\nAnd then, the big day came. We started at 5:30 a.m. toes in the water (TITW) in complete darkness, adding an extra layer of challenge to an already difficult task. The first hour was quite the challenge. The cold took over my thoughts, I shivered a lot, and doubt crept in. I seriously considered quitting. But then Carol, an experienced marathon swimmer, encouraged me to do a few sprints with her. That simple shift in focus made all the difference. As we picked up the pace, my mind let go of the cold, and my body slowly started to accept it. It never stopped being cold, but swimming next to my awesome kayaker, Summer, who was a steady presence throughout the swim and made sure I had feeds every 30 minutes, helped carry me through the full six hours.\nThis experience was more than just a physical test; it was a lesson in resilience, in accepting discomfort rather than fighting it. It reinforced my confidence for the English Channel, which is now just two months away. If all goes well with the weather, my crossing will take place in the first week of June.\nFor now, my training remains focused on one hour speed sessions to build efficiency, combined with long back to back swims on Saturdays and Sundays to replicate endurance fatigue. I’ve now built up to 5 hour and 6 hour back to back swims on weekends without too much discomfort afterward. This coming weekend, I’ll attempt a 6 hour/6 hour back to back swim to keep pushing the envelope. As spring progresses, I’m eagerly waiting for the lakes to thaw so I can get back into even colder open water.\nWith each passing week, the Channel swim feels more real. There’s still plenty of hard work ahead, but I’m feeling stronger, more prepared, and more determined than ever.\nOn the fundraising front, things are going great! We’ve raised over $1,600 CAD for tree planting with Project Forest and the Siksika Nation, and I’m so grateful for everyone who has contributed.\nThanks for following along—more updates to come soon!\nFor more frequent updates follow me on Strava and Instagram.\n\n\n\nSunset in La Jolla"

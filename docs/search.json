This endeavor isn’t just about personal achievement; it also reflects my commitment to environmental protection. Currently, fewer than 2000 people have managed to cross the English Channel. As part of my goal to plant 1 million trees, I’ve created a GoFundMe page for this event. Take a look and let’s work together to reforest the planet, one tree at a time."

    "text": "Hello, I’m Stefan – Nice to meet you!\nI’m a husband, father of 3, biologist, and endurance athlete from Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. In 2024 at the age of 44 years old, I established my ultimate life goal of raising funds to plant 1 million trees. My mission is to achieve this goal through challenging ultra-endurance events.\nI’ve completed numerous Ironman Triathlons (9:23:51), including the Ironman World Championships in Kona, Hawaii (10:06:53), ultramarathons of up to 100 miles (19:56:50), and also hold the course record in the 100 km Lost Soul Ultra Marathon in Lethbridge, Alberta, Canada (10:07:00).\nEager to know more about my journey? Don’t hesitate to reach out (carbs4trees at gmail dot com)!"

Starting something new is always difficult. Raising a family is very difficult. Staying mentally healthy is extremely difficult. Mastering life, especially during the years when it matters most, is probably the most difficult.

Why am I telling you all this? Isn't this website about crazy endurance events? Yes, it is. Life is by far the craziest endurance event of all.

But here I wanted to take a minute and update you on my journey to swim across the English Channel!

When I look back at June 2024, it feels like a whirlwind of cold water, determination, and heartwarming support. My journey toward swimming the English Channel took me to Dover, a place that’s become a hub for open-water swimmers dreaming of crossing that legendary stretch of water.

## Training in Dover: Cold, Long, and (Mostly) Amazing

Dover was every bit as challenging as I’d imagined. I joined the Dover Channel Training Group, a fantastic community of swimmers who welcomed me with open arms. The water hovered around 15°C (59°F), and while that might sound unbearable to some, it became my new normal.

Over the 2 weeks, I pushed my body to adapt. One-hour swims turned into two, then three, then four. The cold was a constant companion, but there’s something magical about getting lost in the rhythm of your stroke, with nothing but the sound of the water around you.

Despite all the progress, I didn’t manage to complete my six-hour qualifying swim—an essential milestone for my English Channel attempt in June 2025. The rules require that this swim be done in water no warmer than 15.6°C (60°F), which adds an extra layer of challenge to an already grueling task. I won’t lie; it was frustrating to fall short. I’d come so far but still had this big box left to check.

## The Heart of My Journey: Planting Trees with Project Forest

Even when the swim got tough, there was one thing that kept me going: the overwhelming support for my fundraiser. I’m partnering with **Project Forest** to plant trees for the **Siksika Nation in Alberta**, and the generosity of friends, family, and strangers has been nothing short of inspiring.

Last month, we hit a major milestone—**\$1,105 raised**! Every donation feels like a cheer from the sidelines, reminding me that this journey is about more than just crossing a channel. It’s about making a tangible difference for our planet and supporting Project Forest in their incredible work planting trees.

## Looking Ahead: La Jolla and the Next Big Challenge

So, what’s next? The English Channel is still on the horizon, but first, I need to conquer that six-hour swim. In March, I’ll head to La Jolla, California, where the cold Pacific waters will give me the chance to complete this essential milestone.

The challenge won’t be easy. I’ll need to endure both the physical toll of long-distance swimming and the mental battle of pushing through hours of frigid water. But I’m ready to face it head-on, with the lessons I’ve learned in Dover and the encouragement of everyone who’s supported me so far.

## The Journey Continues

June 2025 might feel far away, but I know it’ll come faster than I expect. Between now and then, I’ll keep swimming, fundraising, and staying focused on the goal.

To everyone who’s cheered me on, donated, or shared kind words—you’re as much a part of this journey as I am. Thank you for believing in me and for supporting this effort to give back to the planet and the Siksika Nation.
